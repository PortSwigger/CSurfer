<p>This extension automatically handles anti-CSRF tokens, and hides the 
mechanism from the browser (or other tool) that is using Burp. It tracks the 
most recent token received in a response, and ensures that each request always 
contains the latest token. </p>
<p>It also allows Burp to be chained as an upstream proxy from other security scanning tools that are not CSRF-aware.</p>
<p>Requires Java version 7.</p>
